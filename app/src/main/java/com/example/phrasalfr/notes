PhrasalFR Notes!


ToDo:
> Set up quiz!
    > Start adding on clicks for audio and answer selection
    > Correct or wrong pop up
    > Submit button? Would kind of be needed for the audio function so you can hear the phrases
    before submitting
> Create queries that get all phrases by list/category

Started adding answer functionality for the quiz. Answers load english and french text.;

Add sharedPrefs for quiz settings!

Maybe use SharedPreferences to save the titles of the lists. Seems a lot easier then
doing a weird DB query.
 > Actually a db querry for all categories, and then passing that to programmatically create chips is probly the most
 correct way
 > Or maybe not?.. Just add a set of strings to the sharedPrefs that contains the categories, and then use that set
  amd String to query the db for all Phrases with the same String?

6/5/22
