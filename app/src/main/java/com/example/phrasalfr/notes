ToDo:
Set up quiz!
> Create queries that get all phrases by list/category

Bugs:
Fix git log credentials.. -_-
Still crashing on fresh install?
Setting visibility with text View and ImageButton not working programmatically?

Add sharedPrefs for quiz settings!

Maybe use SharedPreferences to save the titles of the lists. Seems a lot easier then
doing a weird DB query.
 > Actually a db querry for all categories, and then passing that to programmatically create chips is probly the most
 correct way
 > Or maybe not?.. Just add a set of strings to the sharedPrefs that contains the categories, and then use that set
  amd String to query the db for all Phrases with the same String?

6/5/22
Set up DB and basic navigation
Implement add Phrases
