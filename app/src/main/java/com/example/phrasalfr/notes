PhrasalFR Notes!


ToDo:

> User Phrase category will crash if there isn't enough data to build the quiz
    > Index out of bounds

> Make it so that the quiz feature does not repeat phrases, or just loops through every phrase.
    > Weird when the same phrase appears many times in a row
    > Add a counter so you know how many entires are left.
        > How many right or wrong.

> Simplify categories into Phrases and vocab


****************************************************************************************************
Feature Ideas:

> Add a streak feature
> Add a feature where you have to add phrases to the db every day
> Add a feature where you can create your own category
    > School, Work, Cooking, ext
> Add a feature where you chose which category to add phrases to

****************************************************************************************************
Bugs:

> Fix the runBlocking{} configuration. Not a great practice.
> Read about Coroutines!! runBlocking{} is not the best way. Blocks the main thread
    > Use other scopes in combination with LiveData to load quiz data in real time with out blocking
      the main thread

> User Phrase category will crash if there isn't enough data to build the quiz
    > Index out of bounds

On fresh install, default sharedPrefs for question and answer not formatting quiz correctly
User should be able to click right on to quiz on first install without making quiz settings

Fixed:

> MainViewModel is not initialized properly! It's resetting or recreating a viewmodel each time the fragment changes

> Also play audio automatically when French audio is selected.
French audio for French Text quiz setting not playing on first click from quiz

Small bug where if you don't click the answer, it will be wrong even if it's right
    > You have to click to actually select the answer, even if it is shown as selected.

Setting visibility with text View and ImageButton not working programmatically?

App appears to crash if you switch screens and the translator is not done downloading
Also looks like it crashes when go to quiz without selecting settings.

Still crashing on fresh install?
    > DB isn't "primed".. If you add an entry to it, then all the other data shows up
    > But until you make that first request, you can't getAllPhrases. Always returns null
    on the first try, but works after that..
    > DB is primed in PhrasalFRApplication.. So now it works on Fresh install, but that's pretty weird.

***Work Log***

> Be able to view a list of all phrases and words. Add or remove them from the db.


9/9/22
Refactored viewModels

8/22/22

Simplifying the question process and database stuff
Also.. If you build the question first on the Home Page, and then pass it into the Quiz.. You won't
have to runBlocking.. Or just have some timer that automatically refreshes the Quiz page.

Implemented start of load phrases by category feature.
Wrote some database tests

7/11/22
Pre populate DB with a db file generated in SQLiteBrowser

6/16/22
Added some audio for the french text
Wrote some basic navigation tests

6/15/22
> Set up quiz!
    > Start adding on clicks for audio and answer selection
    > Correct or wrong pop up
    > Submit button? Would kind of be needed for the audio function so you can hear the phrases
    before submitting

> Fix git log credentials.. -_-
    > Testing out the git... again!
    > Looks like it's at least pushed!
    > Testing again.

6/12/22
Started adding answer functionality for the quiz. Answers load english and french text.;

6/9/22
Add sharedPrefs for quiz settings!

6/6/22
Maybe use SharedPreferences to save the titles of the lists. Seems a lot easier then
doing a weird DB query.
 > Actually a db querry for all categories, and then passing that to programmatically create chips is probly the most
 correct way
 > Or maybe not?.. Just add a set of strings to the sharedPrefs that contains the categories, and then use that set
  amd String to query the db for all Phrases with the same String?

6/5/22
Set up DB and basic navigation
Implement add Phrases
