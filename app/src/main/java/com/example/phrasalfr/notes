PhrasalFR Notes!


ToDo:
> Time to write some test cases!!!
    > Unit tests for the database
    > UI Tests for the fragments
    > GO!

> Create queries that get all phrases by list/category
> Pre populate the database


************************************************************************************************************
Bugs:
> Also play audio automatically when French audio is selected.
French audio for French Text quiz setting not playing on first click from quiz

On fresh install, default sharedPrefs for question and answer not formatting quiz correctly
User should be able to click right on to quiz on first install without making quiz settings


Fixed:
Small bug where if you don't click the answer, it will be wrong even if it's right
    > You have to click to actualy select the answer, even if it is shown as selected.

Setting visibility with text View and ImageButton not working programmatically?

App appears to crash if you switch screens and the translator is not done downloading
Also looks like it crashes when go to quiz without selecting settings.

Still crashing on fresh install?
    > DB isn't "primed".. If you add an entry to it, then all the other data shows up
    > But until you make that first request, you can't getAllPhrases. Always returns null
    on the first try, but works after that..
    > DB is primed in PhrasalFRApplication.. So now it works on Fresh install, but that's pretty weird.

> Set up quiz!
    > Start adding on clicks for audio and answer selection
    > Correct or wrong pop up
    > Submit button? Would kind of be needed for the audio function so you can hear the phrases
    before submitting

> Fix git log credentials.. -_-
    > Testing out the git... again!
    > Looks like it's at least pushed!
    > Testing again.

Started adding answer functionality for the quiz. Answers load english and french text.;

6/9/22
Add sharedPrefs for quiz settings!

6/6/22
Maybe use SharedPreferences to save the titles of the lists. Seems a lot easier then
doing a weird DB query.
 > Actually a db querry for all categories, and then passing that to programmatically create chips is probly the most
 correct way
 > Or maybe not?.. Just add a set of strings to the sharedPrefs that contains the categories, and then use that set
  amd String to query the db for all Phrases with the same String?

6/5/22
Set up DB and basic navigation
Implement add Phrases
